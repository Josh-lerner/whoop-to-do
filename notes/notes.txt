ES6 for server-side (NodeJS) code
NodeJS
Express
RESTful routes
One or more CSS or UI "framework"s:
jQuery
A CSS preprocessor such as SASS, Stylus, or PostCSS for styling -- or CSS Custom properties and no CSS preprocessor
PostgreSQL and pg (with promises) for DBMS
git for version control

Requirements:
Each todo created should be categorized as one of:

Film / Series (To watch)
Restaurants, cafes, etc. (To eat)
Books (To read)
Products (To buy)
In order to determine the category the app will probably need to use various API services such as those offered by Google, Wolfram Alpha, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, Yelp and others.

API services mentioned above are only suggestions. You will have to investigate how to balance the accurate categorization of items with having to deal with multiple API endpoints.

Users should be able to change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

Users should be able to register, log in, log out and update their profile.


* How We Work Together *
-working as a team, staying at the same pace, no one left behind!
-any code modications should be done either in pair programming or unanimous decision.
-Be respectful to eachother OR ELSE!
